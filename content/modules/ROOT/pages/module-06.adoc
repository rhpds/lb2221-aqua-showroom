We can build a complete IoT platform for Smart Aquaculture using Smart Data models from the open source FIWARE community. 
We also deploy FIWARE microservices like a context broker to publish Smart Data Models in the Smart Aquaculture platform, 
and register entities with the FIWARE Context Broker. 
Then we can visualize the Smart Data Models in a custom data-driven website, or in the https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/marketing-toolbox/material/FIWAREBrochure_Marketplace.pdf[FIWARE Marketplace]. 

With the Computate AI code genreration tools. We can automatically generate OpenAPI specs, database table schemas, Java models, Vert.x Reactive Java APIs, Handlebars HTML page templates, JavaScript page and API functions, NGSI-LD Context data, OpenShift Custom Resource Definitions, and Ansible Operator roles and playbooks for any of the hundreds of open source Edge device data related https://github.com/smart-data-models[FIWARE Smart Data Models available here].
