== Building a Smart Aquaculture platform in the cloud

Thanks to the powerful cloud developer tools built into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, developers can log into a VSCode workbench directly in the browser and start developing a Smart Aquaculture platform.
The OpenShift AI workbenches provided by Red Hat allow developers to write code in the browser, it doesn't matter what your computer's architecture or operating system is.

== Access the OpenShift Console

The OpenShift Console is the visual web-based way of interacting with your cloud deployments.

{console_url}[Log in to the OpenShift Console^] with username `{user}` password `{password}`.

To access your resources in the OpenShift Console:

- on the left side of the page, click on `+Workloads+` â†’ `+Pods+`.
- At the top left side of the page, click on the `+Project+` dropdown and select `workbench-{user}`.

There should be 2 pods listed:
- One Pod that starts with `+deploy-workbench+` that was a Job that ran to Status Completed to set up the workbench automatically with everything you need to get started.
- One Pod `+vscode-0+` that is your own VSCode workbench.
