== Building a Smart Aquaculture platform in the cloud

Thanks to the powerful cloud developer tools built into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, developers can log into a VSCode workbench directly in the browser and start developing a Smart Aquaculture platform.
The OpenShift AI workbenches provided by Red Hat allow developers to write code in the browser, it doesn't matter what your computer's architecture or operating system is.

== Access the OpenShift Console

The OpenShift Console is the visual web-based way of interacting with your cloud deployments.

Log in to the {console_url}[OpenShift Console] with username {user} password {password}.

To access your resources in the OpenShift Console:

- on the left side of the page, click on `+Workloads+` â†’ `+Pods+`.
- At the top left side of the page, click on the `+Project+` dropdown and select `+workbench-{user}+`.

There should be 2 pods listed:
- One Pod that starts with `+deploy-workbench+` that was a Job that ran to Status Completed to set up the workbench automatically with everything you need to get started.
- One Pod `+vscode-0+` that is your own VSCode workbench.

== Build the Smart Aquaculture platform from scratch

Begin building the Smart Aquaculture platform from scratch by following the first `+00-create-scaffolding-code.ipynb+` Jupyter Notebook in the files of VSCode and running each command in the Jupyter Notebook with the Bash Kernel.
